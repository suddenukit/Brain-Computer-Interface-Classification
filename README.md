Brain computer interfaces can convert human brain’s signal
to numerical numbers. Different pattern of the signal numbers of
brains usually indicates different thought of human. This project
takes various samples of human brains’ signal and its
corresponding thought of movement direction to train models.
The models can be used to predict the humans’ thought of
movement from their brain signal data. Support vector machine and other mathine learning algorithms 
were applied.
